# Freeman - A Half-Life: Alyx Non-VR Mod

This mod is designed to run Half-Life: Alyx without the VR hardware requirement and without the contraints/viruses/missing parts of some other non-vr mods.

This new version is based on [bfeber's HLA-NoVR mod](https://github.com/bfeber/HLA-NoVR) with some quality of life changes.

The intended audience of this mod are those who are unable to use VR (sight issues, other disabilities, money contraints etc) or those who simply do not want to keep getting out their VR equipment for short periods of gaming.

If you can use VR and haven't yet played HL: Alyx in VR, I would suggest to do so.  Using this mod turns the game into a different experience, but no less fun.

Please read this to the end as it contains some helpful hints in the FAQ section to help make your way through the game.
